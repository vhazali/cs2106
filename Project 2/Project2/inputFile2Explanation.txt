expected result = 1024

Attempt to ensure that the allocation of Page tables is done only when there are two consecutive empty frames.

After init, frames free are 1, 2, 5-10 and 13-1024
Frame 0 is taken by ST, 3 and 4 is taken by Page table created by init, 11 and 12 also by page table created by init.

After first input, frame 1 is taken.

Second input attempts to create a new PT and a new page.
Correct implementation would create a new PT at frames 5 and 6, and a new page at frame 2. 

At the end of the file, frames taken are 0-6 , 11 and 12.
