Input:
0 1048576 

Interpreted as: 
Read,
s = 2
p = 0
w = 0
expected result = 512

Rationale:
Accessing an already declared page
To check if init was done properly for segment 2


Input:
0 1572864 

Interpreted as:
Read,
s = 3
p = 0
w = 0
expected result = 1024

Rationale:
Accessing an alredy declared page
To check if init was done properly for segment 3

Input:
1 1049088 

Interpreted as:

s = 2
p = 1
w = 0
expected result = 1536

Rationale:
Test out creating a new page from an available slot in the page table

Input:
1 1573376 

Interpreted as:

s = 3
p = 1
w = 0
expected result = 3072

Rationale:
Test out creating a new page from an available slot in the page table
Ensure that bitMap updates the bits properly when a new page is declared

Input:
1 524288
Interpreted as:

s = 1
p = 0
w = 0
expected result = 4608

Rationale:
Test out creating both a new page table and a new page together.
Attempts to create a new page table by accessing segment 1 which is undeclared
Then attempts to create a new page by accessing page 0 of segment 1, which is available




Untested:
bitMap having to find 2 consecutive empty slots before allocating it to a page table
